# My Golang Webhooks

This project is a Golang application that handles webhooks. It provides a web server that listens for incoming webhook requests and processes them based on their event type.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-golang-webhooks.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Build the application:

   ```bash
   go build ./cmd
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./cmd
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will listen for incoming webhook requests on the specified port. You can configure the port in the `main.go` file.

To handle different types of webhook events, modify the `webhook.go` file in the `internal/handlers` directory. The `HandleWebhook` function contains the logic for processing the webhook payload.

The `webhook_service.go` file in the `internal/services` directory provides the business logic for processing webhooks. You can modify this file to add additional validation or processing logic.
